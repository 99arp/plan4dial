1. If you want a branch, then you have to have a context dependent determiner, that takes input from the both of the files 
2. In context dependent determination, DO NOT put two values for one variable. This gave me some bugs, which i could not resolve. 


While creating a resetable dialog, 
you have to specifiy the second outcome. We select the second outcome, if the intents do not match to any expected inputs. 

THE SAME APPLIES FOR Slot_fill more type action.  DONOT put additional outcomes not related to the task there.
